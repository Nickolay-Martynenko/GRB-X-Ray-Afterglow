# Models
To make it easier to reporduce all the experiments without thinking of data loading and data preprocessing (e.g. in Google Colab), the data sets are downloaded directly from this repository using `curl`. If one prefers to use local paths instead of URLs, it can be achieved manually (see `dataset` directory in this repository).
